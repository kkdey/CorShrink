  abstract    = "We describe a model-based clustering method for using
                 multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and
                 assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which
                 there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of
                 which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each
                 locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned
                 (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more
                 populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed.
                 Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and
                 it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic
                 markers, provided that they are not closely linked.
                 Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence
                 of population structure, assigning individuals to populations,
                 studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed
                 individuals. We show that the method can produce highly
                 accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven
                 microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an
                 endangered bird species. The software used for this article is

                 of diploid cell populations, but studies addressing allelic
                 expression patterns genome-wide in single cells are lacking.
                 Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across
                 individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed
                 background (CAST/EiJ $\times$ C57BL/6J). We discovered
                 abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal
                 genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs
                 independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and
                 dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely
                 related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic
                 expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic
                 expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation
                 of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and
                 stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random
                 monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.",

                 dissection of tissues into mixtures of cellular subpopulations
                 is currently challenging. We introduce an automated massively
                 parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach for
                 analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of
                 single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification
                 algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type
                 characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell
                 transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional
                 hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity
                 and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen
                 activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through
                 inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than
                 a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data

                 comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.",
